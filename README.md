# Living the simple life
This application was built to practice building a responsive design using flexbox I used flexbox because of its many features, As It:
* can be laid out in any flow direction (leftwards, rightwards, downwards, or even upwards!)
* can have display order reversed or rearranged at the style layer (i.e., visual order can be independent of source and speech order)
* can be laid out linearly along a single (main) axis or wrapped into multiple lines along a secondary (cross) axis
* can “flex” their sizes to respond to the available space
* can be aligned with respect to their container or each other
* can be dynamically collapsed or uncollapsed along the main axis while preserving the container’s cross size.
